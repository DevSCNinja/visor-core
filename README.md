Introducing Visor NFT vault. 

- A Visor 2.x vaults allow for management and permissioning of ERC20, ERC721 assets for use by external protocols for such purposes as active LP token management or directly by user for such purposes as for asset timelocks and NFT collection and LP position management. 

- Visor is a living Smart Vault platform and compatibility layer within the emerging DeFi ecosystem built on the UniversalVault standard developed by the [Alchemist](alchemist.wtf) project.

- Use Visor.sol 2.0.x as a base and submit your template proposals for admission at [snapshot.org/#/visor.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/visor.eth)

Stay tuned for more to come!
